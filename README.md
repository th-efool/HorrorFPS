The Frost Of Endless Tomorrow
You wake up in a nightmare.
Play as Elliot, a man stuck in a loop of frozen hellscapes, hallucinations, and fractured memories. One moment you’re in a rotting house, the next a forest where the snow bleeds. Every corner hides clues to why you’re here—and why you can’t leave.

Time loops. Fading memories. A world that wants you to forget.
How far will you go to escape a tomorrow that never comes? Will you break the cycle, or will you succumb to the frost?

Inspiration
The story of this game was inspired with themes of an psychological-thriller novel, that i have been writting in my mean-time. Thrillers and Horror media has always been so captivating to me.

This project was built with a focus on modular systems and dynamic event management to create an immersive and replayable experience. With easy to expand systems.

Below, you’ll find an overview of the core systems and mechanics that bring this haunting world to life.

Core Systems Overview
Interaction System
IInteract - interacting with door, keys, lever, buttons and other interactable objects. ILightSource - Used to run "FlickerLight()" (flickering effect) and "DestroyBulb()" (On encounter with ghost the first time, triggered.) IPlayer - Used to trigger functions inside PlayerCharacter script like Hallucination() function, which enables PostProcess() component.

Event Manager System
EventManagment GameObject+Script is used to trigger/manage events

EventsEnumeration

LightFlicker
Halucinations
BlackOut
SoundPlay
ShowMessage
JumpScareEvent
DisablePlayerTorch
Each Instance of EventManagerSystem of has, variables that can be edited based on instance in editor.

EventIndex (Events Enumeration datatype) - this one decides which main thing the particular EventObject would trigger before getting destroyed.
SendMessageToo? (bool)
PlaySoundAsWell? (bool)
 DisablePlayerLights? (bool) and DisableLightsFor (float)
HallucinationsAsWell? (bool)
based on which bool is active, aside from the Event in EventIndex in getting triggered you can send/show/trigger multiple functions based on use-case. (like at one place i might desire to - show an message+sound), in one i might want (sound+hallucination+lightflicker) - so according to the scene dynamic need we can

OnBeginOverlap() when condition ActorHasTag("Player") is met, triggers the (Event in EventIndex) & Other Events based on which bool active

User Interface System
Functions List

UILoadChapter(Int LevelIndex, Int Duration) - This function is responsible for showing opening text of every new chapter
UIMessageDisplay(Text Text) - responsible for showing dialogues and informative texts (ex-picked up Kitch key, You need ABC to open this door.)
UIDisplayDiary(Text Title, Text Entry) - Trigged when player interacts with an DiaryActor/NotesActor/etc - to display it's content.
UIUnDisplayDiary()
UINoobsGuide() - Displays UI for which key is responsible for what action (RMB-Interact, X-DropItem, LMB - UVFlashlight)
PlayerCharacter Script & GameObject
Some Important Functionalities

Responsible for taking keyboard inputs and running functionality relating to said function
There's an SphereCollider attached that
OnBeginOverlap() - checks for any interactable object (Does Object Implement Interface? == IInteract), to give player heads-up w/ UINoobsGuide() for how to interact with the object.
When user press InputActionKey for Interact, we iterate through all overlapping objects to check for (Does Object Implement Interface? == IInteract) if yes, then Trigger Interact(this) function utilizing the IInteract interface
Also there's an postprocess component attached to this, that is enabled every time we wish to display hallucinations and other effects.
Two Spot Light Components
one with shorter cone angle (serves as flashlight)
other with bigger cone angle (at low illuminosity) (to give an general ambient illumination to surrounding) for an much better experience
Keys/Possessable PickUp System
The data of whether player possess an key/possessable item is stored in an Bool Array, whose indexes correspond to which is stored in an Enum (like 0=BedRoomKey 1=KitchenKey,..)

When IInteract() function is run, it updates BoolArray set value at (int)EnumGameObject
